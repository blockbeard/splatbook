# Companion App — Implementation Plan (commit by commit)

*Drafted 2026-07-10; split 2026-07-16. This file holds only **unbuilt** work: the next unbuilt commit is the top of the first phase below. Completed phases (0–20, commits 1–122, through the v2.2.0 binder release) live in [[App Implementation History]] — append-only, decisions preserved. **Housekeeping rule:** when a phase completes, move its section to the history file verbatim in the same commit that closes it (milestone commits already do docs work; this rides along). Anything still listed here is not built. As of v2.2.0 no commits are planned in detail — the v2.3 candidates below are the queue to draw the next phase from.*

*The framework is **Splatbook** (splatbook.app); the first game module is a Stonetop companion at `/stonetop`. The framework-question essay, the naming story, and the Ringwall retirement are in the history file.*

## Ground rules

- Every commit builds, type-checks (`npm run check`), and passes tests. No broken states in history.
- Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`); scopes: `shell`, `packs`, `reference`, `stonetop`, `wizard`, `play`, `steading`, `gm`, `db`, `auth` — grown since by use: `tools`, `campaigns`, `e2e`, `ci`, `cloudflare`, and `ops` (monitoring/backup). A `content:` type covers data reimports (commit 91).
- Saved blobs migrate on load. Each game module owns a `migrate*` function per entity type (`migrateCharacter`, `migrateSteading`, `migrateThreat`), called wherever a blob is read. Any commit that changes a blob's shape bumps that module's `SCHEMA_VERSION` and extends the migration **in the same commit**, with a test that loads a fixture of the old shape. A character saved at v0.1 opens in every later version; anything else is data loss on a timer.
- Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` current (Keep a Changelog format).
- Stack: SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5 runes, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, Drizzle + SQLite (local/staging) / D1 (prod), Auth.js, Zod, Vitest + Playwright. Same as Arrowed's — deliberate, so his code remains a reference and future collaboration stays easy.
- Characters/steadings stored as one JSON blob per row with `schemaVersion`, `gameId`, `entityType` — the one genuinely universal persistence model.
- Three rules, enforced from commit 1: the shell only touches game code through the `GameModule` registry; game modules never import each other; every game-visible string lives in a content pack, never in app code ("game-visible" means game *content* — shell chrome is app copy and exempt).

*Toward v2.3: offline/PWA first (precache the static reference + a web manifest, then a write queue for sheets), and the user-facing half of the data-safety story (a "download my data" JSON export on the dashboard — the operator half, the scheduled D1 export, was pulled forward into phase 19). Both were reviewed 2026-07-12 and deferred, not rejected. Also parked from the Hearthfire review: lines-and-veils safety tools (excluded / veiled / special handling) and shared "Threats" / "I wonder…" boards on the campaign dashboard — cheap, very Stonetop, and worth doing once the session ledger exists to hold them.*

## Sequencing notes

- Natural session-sized bites: a phase-boundary milestone every 5–10 commits, and each commit is small enough to finish in one sitting.
- When the itch for game #2 arrives (HMtW is the obvious candidate — Arrowed's pack data may even be importable), the test of the framework is that it touches only `content-packs/hmtw/` and `src/lib/games/hmtw/`. If it needs shell changes, that's the extraction moment — do it then, with two real games in hand, not now with one.
