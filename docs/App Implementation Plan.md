# Companion App — Implementation Plan (commit by commit)

*Drafted 2026-07-10; split 2026-07-16. This file holds only **unbuilt** work: the next unbuilt commit is the top of the first phase below. Completed phases (0–20, commits 1–122, through the v2.2.0 binder release) live in [[App Implementation History]] — append-only, decisions preserved. **Housekeeping rule:** when a phase completes, move its section to the history file verbatim in the same commit that closes it (milestone commits already do docs work; this rides along). Anything still listed here is not built.*

*The framework is **Splatbook** (splatbook.app); the first game module is a Stonetop companion at `/stonetop`. The framework-question essay, the naming story, and the Ringwall retirement are in the history file.*

## Ground rules

- Every commit builds, type-checks (`npm run check`), and passes tests. No broken states in history.
- Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`); scopes: `shell`, `packs`, `reference`, `stonetop`, `wizard`, `play`, `steading`, `gm`, `db`, `auth` — grown since by use: `tools`, `campaigns`, `e2e`, `ci`, `cloudflare`, `pdf`, and `ops` (monitoring/backup). A `content:` type covers data reimports (commit 91).
- Saved blobs migrate on load. Each game module owns a `migrate*` function per entity type (`migrateCharacter`, `migrateSteading`, `migrateThreat`), called wherever a blob is read. Any commit that changes a blob's shape bumps that module's `SCHEMA_VERSION` and extends the migration **in the same commit**, with a test that loads a fixture of the old shape. A character saved at v0.1 opens in every later version; anything else is data loss on a timer.
- Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` current (Keep a Changelog format).
- Stack: SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5 runes, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, Drizzle + SQLite (local/staging) / D1 (prod), Auth.js, Zod, Vitest + Playwright. Same as Arrowed's — deliberate, so his code remains a reference and future collaboration stays easy.
- Characters/steadings stored as one JSON blob per row with `schemaVersion`, `gameId`, `entityType` — the one genuinely universal persistence model.
- Three rules, enforced from commit 1: the shell only touches game code through the `GameModule` registry; game modules never import each other; every game-visible string lives in a content pack, never in app code ("game-visible" means game *content* — shell chrome is app copy and exempt).

*Toward v2.3: offline/PWA first (precache the static reference + a web manifest, then a write queue for sheets), and the user-facing half of the data-safety story (a "download my data" JSON export on the dashboard — the operator half, the scheduled D1 export, was pulled forward into phase 19). Both were reviewed 2026-07-12 and deferred, not rejected. Also parked from the Hearthfire review: lines-and-veils safety tools (excluded / veiled / special handling) and shared "Threats" / "I wonder…" boards on the campaign dashboard — cheap, very Stonetop, and worth doing once the session ledger exists to hold them.*

## Phase 21 — Manual test follow-ups (v2.2.0 binder pass)

*Chris ran the first human-in-a-browser pass over the binder release (commits
110–122) against `docs/Manual Test Checklist.md`, 2026-07-17 + follow-up
review notes, triaged 2026-07-22. ~30 findings, deduped by root cause. Two
items below aren't fixes: the `-webkit-text-size-adjust` console warning
looks like a Firefox-vs-Tailwind quirk rather than app code (worth one look,
not a commit), and the dev-mode CF-beacon check just needs a documented
way to verify it, not a code change. Order below is severity, not
necessarily commit order — Priority 1 goes first regardless.*

**Priority 1 — data-loss / correctness (do these first):**

*All shipped: the garbled-PDF Avara embed (`eeef50c`), long-text pagination
(`04bb9d5`), the steading-editor revoke (`e650de6`), the character-debility
model (three conditions over linked stat pairs, rolled at disadvantage —
confirmed against Harm and Healing), and steading debility effects
(diminished/lacking/malcontent per the playbook; the seasonal Fortunes
reset now exists and is +0 while malcontent).*

**Priority 2 — systemic: vault markdown leaking into the UI.** *All shipped:
the tree-free wikilink pass + derived `link-index.json` artifact
(`feat(reference)`), then wired into `/stonetop/table`, the play-mode Moves
tab / level-up cards, and every steading text surface (tracker moves,
improvement effects, the sheet's list lines — the literal-asterisk horses).*

**Priority 3 — wizard input bugs:**

- `fix(wizard)`: Appearance step needs a write-in option; a made selection
  can't be unchecked/cleared.
- `fix(wizard)`: Ranger's "something wicked this way comes" insert is
  missing the answer box for its questions.

**Priority 4 — steading fixes (bundle, several small commits):**

- `fix(steading)`: edit-steading button reads as a back button —
  affordance fix.
- `fix(steading)`: steading size doesn't track population.
- `fix(steading)`: "herd of horses" asset-name upgrade doesn't auto-apply
  on the sheet once the requirement is met — currently text-only.
- `fix(steading)`: link labelled "edit steading" should read "edit/play"
  once both modes exist behind one control.
- `chore(steading)`: drop the redundant Moves & gear link from the steading
  play surface.
- `feat(steading)`: PDF should show in-progress improvements, not just
  completed ones.
- `feat(steading)`: export-to-markdown, matching characters.

**Priority 5 — play mode / character sheet UX:**

- `feat(play)`: inserts tab shows a bare "+" with no way to tell which
  insert is which — needs an "add insert" menu plus a way to remove one.

**Priority 6 — campaign & GM tooling:**

- `fix(campaigns)`: steading rolls don't reach the roll log (player-sheet
  rolls do).
- `feat(gm)`: GM should be able to see player sheets.
- `fix(stonetop)`: arcana on a player sheet can only be the custom kind —
  pre-written arcana aren't selectable; separately, "Mystery" unlocks on a
  single mark, which is probably wrong (check the rules text for the real
  threshold).
- `feat(campaigns)`: Characters view needs a "create a character" button.
- `feat(campaigns)`: finishing a character build inside a campaign needs an
  explicit attach-to-campaign-or-leave-unassigned choice.
- `feat(shell)`: dashboard is missing a Threats link (Characters/Steadings
  are there).

**Priority 7 — end of session / session log:**

- `fix(campaigns)`: end-of-session notes — reloading before marking
  preserves the draft text but not checkbox state.
- `fix(campaigns)`: "turn the season" works but gives no feedback and the
  UI stays on the old season until a manual reload.
- `fix(campaigns)`: the season display box should show the current season,
  not all four.
- `fix(shell)`: session-log notes should append at the end, not wherever
  they land now.

**Priority 8 — hygiene:**

- `fix(shell)`: Svelte `hydration_mismatch` console error — worth chasing
  even though nothing visibly broke.
- Investigate: `-webkit-text-size-adjust` parse warning — check whether
  it's a dependency's CSS before spending a commit on it.
- Document: how to verify "no CF beacon script in dev" from view-source.

**Optional / nice-to-have, not defects:** gear list's piercing (`x`) note
could link the Prosperity section; auto-updating character sheets the
moment XP is marked at end of session instead of requiring a manual look.

## Phase 23 — HMtW dungeon-seed maps & verified art (parked — scope-creep guard)

*Not v1. Recorded here so the mapping isn't lost. The book's Dungeon Seeds each
get a Dyson Logos map, re-sourced from dysonlogos.blog/maps/commercial-maps/
(free royalty-free commercial license, credit "Dyson Logos" required,
modification permitted — terms checked 2026-08-06). Take the map images from
the individual posts, not the huge PDF. Needs an image-allowlist mechanism in
the pipeline (build_rules currently strips all embeds) and a CREDITS entry per
map. Later still: verified PD/CC-BY book plates per the vault's
`_project/ART-LICENSING.md`.*

| Dungeon Seed | Dyson map(s) |
|---|---|
| The Spires | Lino's Islands in the Sky + Brenton's Watch |
| The Boundless Moat | DiTullio Islands + Greth's Island Keep + Wreck of the Wight's Shadow (boats) |
| The Castle of Crossed Destinies | Aurelon's Keep |
| The Inverted Castle | The Turning Tower |
| The City of Ruin | Darklingtown — Cavern and Spillways District |
| The Pits | The Dark Caverns of Turr |
| Belly of the Beast | Veghul's Drop |
| The Drowned Wedding | Roots of the World |
| The Library Heretical | Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen |
| The Field of Reeds | The Ruins near Elverston Hold |
| The Sepulcher of Titans | Bitterchains Tombs |
| Xania | Darklingtown — Frog Tower |
| The Necropolis of Ot | An-Nayyir's Pyramid (profile) + Barrow Mounds of the Lich & Famous III |
| The Menagerie of Singular Creatures | The Cinder Throne |

| The Undertomb | The Granite Shore |

## Phase 24 — Stonetop: bring the indexes back, as a pinned-terms layer

Restore `Book I Stonetop/20 - Index.md` and `Book II The Wider World/59 - Index.md`
to the Stonetop vault and give Stonetop the curated search layer HMtW got in
phase 22.

They were deleted on purpose — vault commit `9eece3d`, "Delete index, convert
page-refs to heading links, contents link tables, arcana glyphs" — because a
page-number index is dead weight in a digital vault. That reasoning was right
about the page numbers and wrong about the index: the book's own index is a
human-curated term → section map, including "see X" synonyms that keyword search
can't infer. HMtW ships exactly that as `content/hmtw/index-terms.json` (a fork
of the vault's copy, so term fixes live in the repo), which `build_search.ts`
resolves into `pinned-terms.json` and the reader renders as a pinned strip above
the ranked results. Recover the notes with
`git show 9eece3d^:"Book I Stonetop/20 - Index.md"`.

It also closes a live break: a Stonetop reimport today **fails** —
`build_rules.py` reports `unresolved note [[20 - Index]]` and silently drops both
notes from the snapshot, because the contents link tables still point at them
(found 2026-08-08 while fixing the HMtW sidebar hoist; nothing has reimported
Stonetop since the deletion, which is why it went unnoticed).

Steps, roughly:

- Restore both notes, then give them the same treatment the rest of the vault
  got in `9eece3d` — page refs become heading links, not `p. 214`.
- Extract to `content/stonetop/index-terms.json` with validated targets. The
  extractor to port is the HMtW vault's `_project/scripts/build_search_index.py`,
  which now checks every term's (file, anchor) against real headings and block
  ids the way Obsidian compares links — it caught 12 stale targets on its first
  run. Generalise it rather than forking it a third time.
- Two books means two term sets: decide whether Book II terms are GM-gated. The
  precedent exists — HMtW already ships a separate `pinned-terms-gm.json`.

## Phase 27 — Shareable links on headings

*Filed 2026-08-09 out of the design review of `/hmtw`, then argued down over
three passes from "copy the rule text" to this. The decision and the discarded
work are both recorded below, because the discarded parts are the ones a future
attempt would re-derive.*

**Decided (Chris, 2026-08-09): heading links only. Copy-text and
copy-attribution are not being built.**

### The build

Every heading deeper than a game's `referencePageDepth` renders inline on its
page ancestor and already carries an anchor id — 52 of 52 on "An incomplete list
of pretty things", 6 of 6 on "Tests of Fate". The URLs exist, resolve, and have
scroll-margin handling. There is simply no way to *get* one from the interface
short of reading the page source.

That matters because h4+ is the granularity people quote: a talent entry, an
alchemical substance, one of the 52 pretty things — not "chapter nine".

**Wrap the heading's text in a link to its own anchor.** That is the whole
feature:

- desktop: right-click → Copy Link Address
- touch: long-press → Copy Link
- either: tapping it puts the anchor in the address bar, so the URL *is* the
  deep link

No JavaScript, no clipboard API, no Safari user-gesture problem, no
secure-context guard, no popover — and no glyph added to the prose, which killed
every earlier version. A dense page gets links where it would have got 52 UI
buttons, and links are already what a reference book's headings look like.

- `feat(reference)`: emit inline-section headings as anchors to their own id, in
  the one place they are generated. Shell default styling plus a game override:
  quiet by default, underline on hover/focus, never a wall of underlines on a
  52-entry page.

*Design note: the h1 gets nothing — its URL is already in the address bar. Games
with no `referencePageDepth` (stonetop, where every heading is its own page) have
no inline sections and are unaffected.*

### Considered and rejected

**Copy section text as markdown.** The benefit was always narrow: the browser
already puts *two* flavours on the clipboard by itself, so Obsidian (which
converts pasted HTML to markdown) and Google Docs already work perfectly, and
Meet can only show plain text anyway. The entire gain was bold and headings
surviving into Zoom and Discord — the two clients that use the plain flavour,
which the browser strips of markdown syntax. That is not worth a DOM→markdown
serializer, a floating selection control, touch-selection handling, and
cross-browser clipboard code that rots.

**Attribution appended on copy.** Killed by arithmetic (Chris): the attribution
sits at the *end* of the payload, and the payload exceeds the client's limit
about half the time — so the attribution is the first thing truncated, in exactly
the clients it was meant for. A licence notice that disappears when the text is
long enough to need one is worse than none. Heading links moot it anyway: a link
carries no text, so it raises no redistribution question, and the destination
already carries the credits and the licence.

### Client behaviour, kept for whoever revisits this

Chris tested, 2026-08-09. Worth preserving: the format rules were guessed wrong
twice before anyone pasted into a real client.

| | markdown | tables | limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zoom | parses: bold, headings, links | no — cells land as separate lines, reads fine | **1,000 chars** |
| Discord | parses, `#`–`###` only (`####` shows literally) | no | 2,000 free / 4,000 Nitro |
| Meet | none — raw syntax visible | no | — |
| Obsidian | native | yes | — |

Zoom keeps bold by *parsing markdown*, not by taking rich text — an earlier draft
inferred the opposite and built a `text/html` path around it.

Payload sizes, measured across the corpus with a ~130-char attribution included:
median page **1,476** chars, mean 2,342, longest 23,019 ("Cups"). Over Zoom's
1,000: **250 of 364 pages (69%)**. Over Discord free's 2,000: 119 (33%). Over
Nitro's 4,000: 43 (12%).

*Method note, since it earned its keep twice: paste into the real client before
deciding a format rule.*

## Phase 29 — HMtW: a shared card table

*Filed 2026-09-06; **rewritten the same day** after an adversarial review of the
first draft, which proposed porting guild-book's Challenge engine. That draft is
recorded under "Considered and rejected" rather than deleted, because the
reasons it failed are the reasons this one is shaped as it is.*

*Prompted by [Crawlspace](https://worm.jmac.org/) (Jason McIntosh) — a free,
well-made virtual card table for HMtW, closed source with no repo, so there is
nothing to fork. A clean-room build is squarely inside the book's own reuse
grant; Crawlspace's code, assets, and docs prose are not ours to copy, and its
docs were read for **what a card table needs**, not for how it does it. Credit
it as prior art on `/credits` when this ships.*

### The governing principle: permissive, not enforcing

Crawlspace's undo model is the product: a misplay is undone by moving the card
back — including out of someone else's hand — because it is built to behave like
a physical table where you drop something, say "whoops," and pick it up.

This table does the same. **The engine moves cards; it does not rule on
whether a move was legal.** No offered-command set, no rejection of a play the
rules don't sanction, no modelling of Dooms, death, grit, or equipment. Those
belong to the people at the table, who have the book open.

That single decision is what makes this phase small, and it is why the
first draft's plan to port guild-book's Challenge engine was abandoned:
that engine is deliberately the opposite. `command.ts`'s
`legalChallengeCommands` computes what an actor may do and
`applyChallengeCommand` rejects anything else outright — ``reject(
'illegal-command', `${command.type} is not currently offered to this actor`)``
— with a `guard-coverage.test.ts` proving the guards exhaustive. Excellent
work, and the wrong product for this.

### Scope

Two modes over **one persistent deck state**:

- **Decks** — flip the top card to discard, open a discard pane, zoom a card,
  GM reshuffle, automatic reshuffle when a pile empties, Fool-flipped prompt.
- **Challenge** — deal hands, face-down initiative visible only to its owner,
  played and face-down zones, minor actions queued then revealed
  simultaneously, Sweep, an initiative callout strip with ±.

Moving between modes never resets the piles: the deck is table state, and the
modes are two views onto it. **Leaving Challenge dumps every card on the table
to the discard**, behind a confirmation — Crawlspace's answer, and the right
one: this is state semantics, not rule enforcement, and it is the only thing
that makes "one deck across two modes" well-defined when five hands and a
populated initiative strip are still out.

**Undo is universal within reach, and reach stops at another player's hand.**
Any card *on the table* — a deck, a discard, a played card, a face-down card in
an initiative or played slot — may be moved or flipped by any seat, with no
legality check. That is deliberate: a player goes AFK mid-round and someone else
has to flip their face-down card for the turn to proceed. What no seat may do is
reach into another seat's **hand**. Crawlspace permits even that ("ask them to
return it"); we don't, and the divergence is deliberate.

This makes the addressing model load-bearing: **commands name a slot, never a
card.** "Flip whatever is in seat 3's initiative slot" is a command any seat may
send and the server resolves; the card's *identity* still projects only to its
owner until it is face-up. Card ids must never cross the wire to a seat not
entitled to the face — otherwise the reach rule quietly becomes a peek.

**Out of scope, decided:** the Crawl/City/Camp procedure panels (a card flip is
a card flip), the gear model (notches, flickers, lit status, hands/belt/pack
slots), and the one-off city-location workarounds. Tower Gnostic's Scrabble
tiles are out of Crawlspace's jurisdiction and out of ours.

**Also out: save/restore.** Crawlspace has it; we don't need it. With no gear to
preserve, the whole of what a restore would carry is a handful of player names,
and retyping those is not a burden worth a feature. It also removes a genuine
hazard rather than merely declining a nicety — table state contains the undrawn
deck order, so an export handed to a client is the deck handed to a player,
defeating the per-seat projection through a download button. (Crawlspace looks
to have met the same wall: its save file restores players and gear, "not card
state or phase.")

### What we take from guild-book, and what we don't

Chris's fork (`~/Documents/guild-book`, upstream `arrowedisgaming/guild-book`,
GPL-3.0, same stack) has solved two problems worth not re-deriving. Both are
**patterns, a few hundred lines of idea** — not code to lift:

1. **The command protocol.** `session_commands` carries `client_observed_version`,
   `expected_version`, and a `request_hash` for idempotency, against a versioned
   public-state blob. Copy that shape.
2. **Per-recipient secrets.** `campaign_event_secrets` holds a payload keyed to
   (event, recipient), and one combined loader builds every viewer's slice from
   a single read rather than one loader per concern. Copy that shape too.

**Not taken: the Challenge engine.** Beyond the permissive/enforcing mismatch
above, it is not separable from guild-book's domain model. `tenureId` appears
239 times across it — 82 in `reducer.ts` alone — and `ChallengeStateV1` is built
from `participantTenureIds`, `tenureOwners`, `budgets`, `enemyFacts`,
`mulliganUsedThisRound`, and `modifiers`. A tenure is not a seat; the type's own
comment says it "is NOT a user id" and exists because "on death the same user
attaches a NEW tenure." This design has no campaigns, no adventurers, no death,
and guest seats with no user id at all. Pure of UI and DB is not the same as
portable. Nor is `modifiers.ts` a clean thing to drop: it imports *from* the
reducer and re-exports its constants to avoid a cycle, and `ChallengeState`
carries a `modifiers` field the reducer reads.

**Also taken, and genuinely reusable as code:** the deterministic art pipeline
(`scripts/tarot-art/`) — an explicit source map, size variants, and a
hash/dimension/licence manifest with a CI verifier.

### Decisions (Chris, 2026-09-06)

- **Access: standalone token-URL tables with guest seats.** A `tables` row with
  an invite token; a guest claims a seat behind a signed cookie capability, no
  account required; a signed-in user gets their real identity. This deliberately
  does not force campaigns onto HMtW, which contributes no entity types and is
  gated out of campaign creation on exactly that basis
  (`campaigns/+page.server.ts:33`, `+layout.svelte:28`). Optional campaign
  attachment is a later commit, not a prerequisite.
- **Transport: polling, one implementation, everywhere.** Behind a
  `TableTransport` seam so the choice stays reversible, but one code path on
  Cloudflare and on `adapter-node`.

  This reverses a first-pass decision to build Durable Object + WebSocket push
  with two adapters. The goal that decision was serving is that **other people
  can self-host this**, and on inspection it argues the other way. A Durable
  Object is the least self-hostable primitive available — nobody runs one on
  their own box, so that adapter serves splatbook.app alone. And WebSockets add
  three frictions polling does not: a custom server entrypoint (today's
  Dockerfile is a bare `CMD ["node", "build"]`, with no `ws` dependency
  anywhere), reverse-proxy upgrade configuration for every self-hoster, and a
  silent replica trap — in-process fanout assumes one process, so a self-hoster
  who scales to two containers gets two half-tables and no error.

  The real principle underneath was **parity**: self-hosters should not get a
  visibly worse product than the hosted one. Polling everywhere satisfies that
  with one implementation instead of two plus a conformance suite. It is also
  what guild-book runs a real campaign on, at roughly a 1s cadence.

  *The push path, recorded so it can be taken later with evidence rather than in
  advance:* a Durable Object + WebSocket adapter behind the same seam. Its price
  is not just the adapter — Splatbook is on Pages (`pages_build_output_dir`),
  and Cloudflare is explicit that a Durable Object cannot be created and
  deployed within a Pages project. So it needs either a separate Worker with
  bindings declared in both Production and Preview, or a Pages → Workers Static
  Assets migration. guild-book paid exactly that, and its wrangler.toml records
  the sharp edge: a hostname attaches to one service at a time, so the deploy
  fails with "already in use" until the domain is pulled off the Pages project
  first. That is a live-domain cutover on splatbook.app. Take it when a real
  table says the latency is annoying, not before.
- **Seats are approved, not merely claimed.** A joiner supplies a character
  name and waits; the GM admits or declines them. Crawlspace's model, and the
  expectation here is the same as theirs — everyone is on voice, so approval is
  a half-second and an unknown name is obvious. This is what makes a leaked
  token URL survivable: it buys a stranger a pending request, not a seat at a
  live table. "Permissive" governs *rules*, never *seats*; the engine declining
  to rule on whether a play is legal says nothing about who may act.
- **Retention: lazy expiry on read, no scheduler.** A table past its window is
  treated as gone the next time anyone touches it, and its rows are deleted
  then. This needs no cron, which matters because there is nowhere good to put
  one: `.github/workflows/` has only `ci.yml` with no `schedule:`, and the sole
  existing scheduled job is `ops/d1-export.sh`, which by its own header "runs
  from cron on atlas" — so a swept-on-schedule design would make table expiry on
  splatbook.app depend on a home server, and would hand self-hosters nothing at
  all. Rows for tables nobody ever revisits linger; storage is cheap and a
  bounded opportunistic sweep can ride along on any table read if it matters.
- **Route: `/[game=game]/cards`**, with a table at `/[game=game]/cards/[token]`.
  Not `/[game=game]/table` — that path exists and belongs to
  `GameModule.tableReference` (Stonetop's Moves & Gear), and letting "table"
  mean two things inside one game is a confusion that would outlive the phase.
- **Art: ship the provably public-domain colour set first** (see the art
  decision below). A black-and-white set is deferred, not rejected.
- **One narrow `GameModule` slot, named honestly.** The project rule is
  "abstract only when a second game forces it," and no second game is coming —
  Stonetop has no cards. So this adds `GameModule.cardTable?`, which is
  unapologetically about decks, seats, and zones, rather than a speculative
  "live shared surface" contract with pluggable reducers and transports. Adding
  a concrete slot for one consumer is a small, reversible cost; inventing a
  universal abstraction for one consumer is the thing the rule forbids. When a
  second game wants a live surface, *that* is the extraction moment.

### Content pack

HMtW has no `content/hmtw/data/` yet — only generated `rules/`, which is never
hand-edited. This phase creates one (hand-authored, like Stonetop's) holding the
deck composition (suits, ranks, values, the Fool's borrow into the player deck)
and every string the table renders. Zod schemas join `hmtw/pack-schemas.ts`; a
`SCHEMA.md` documents it. No formulas, no rules constants — there are no rules
in this table to hold constants for.

### Commits

1. `feat(shell)`: `tables`/`table_seats` schema, token-URL creation, seat claim
   via signed cookie capability.
2. `feat(shell)`: harden the guest path *before* it can carry a card — rate
   limit, table cap, per-table command ceiling, retention field, and the
   **read** budget. Polling moved the exposure from writes to reads on an
   unauthenticated endpoint: six clients at ~1s for a four-hour session is
   roughly 86k D1 reads for a single table, and nothing stops a visitor opening
   more tables. So: a poll answers from one small indexed read of the table's
   version and returns commands since the client's cursor, never the whole
   state; cadence is adaptive (quicker in Challenge, slower at rest) and pauses
   on a hidden tab, as `RollLog.svelte` already does; idle tables back off
   further; and tables-per-origin is capped.
3. `feat(hmtw)`: `content/hmtw/data/` deck definition, schemas, SCHEMA.md.
4. `feat(hmtw)`: the card-table engine — zones, piles, seeded **server-side**
   shuffle, and move/flip/deal/return addressed **by slot, never by card id**.
   Carries a `schemaVersion` and a `migrateTable` from the first blob written,
   per the ground rule above: tables live for weeks, so a shape change during
   this very phase would otherwise break a table someone is mid-round on. Pure
   TS, test-first, with an old-shape fixture from the commit that first bumps
   it.
5. `feat(hmtw)`: per-seat projection **and its leak tests, in the same commit** —
   a face-down card's identity never reaches a seat not entitled to it.
6. `feat(shell)`: `table_commands`/`table_secrets`, the versioned command
   service (observed/expected version, request-hash idempotency), and the poll
   endpoint plus client sync loop behind the `TableTransport` seam. One
   transport, both hosts.
7. `feat(shell)`: the `GameModule.cardTable` slot, the mounted route, the seat rail.
8. `feat(hmtw)`: Decks mode — flip, discard pane, zoom, reshuffle, Fool prompt.
9. `feat(hmtw)`: Challenge mode — deal, hidden initiative, played/face-down
   zones, minor-action queue and simultaneous reveal, Sweep, callout strip, the
   Fool-was-dealt reshuffle prompt before the next deal (the Fool spans both
   modes; commit 8 covers only the flipped case), and the confirmed
   dump-to-discard on leaving.
10. `feat(hmtw)`: undo and free handling — any card on the table moved or
    flipped by any seat, no legality check; hands stay owner-only.
11. `feat(shell)`: lazy expiry on read.
12. `test(e2e)`: Playwright multi-context — two seats through a full round, with
    hidden information asserted hidden at every step.
13. `docs`: CREDITS (Crawlspace as prior art, guild-book for the two patterns),
    CHANGELOG, pack docs, and the art basis in LICENSE.md.

Thirteen commits. Treat that as a floor rather than an estimate: the first draft
said 25–30 in conversation and then produced a 17-commit list without justifying
the drop, which is exactly the arithmetic this project's history punishes. For
calibration, Origins 5.5e was 6 commits and 10,091 lines *with no shell change*;
this still has a shell slot and a new auth mode, though dropping the second
transport took a whole adapter and its conformance suite out.

### Art — decided

Ship the provably public-domain colour set: Wikimedia Commons' 1909 first
edition, [Category:Rider-Waite tarot deck (Roses &
Lilies)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Rider-Waite_tarot_deck_(Roses_%26_Lilies)),
80 files, complete at 22 majors + 56 minors, named `RWS1909 - 00 Fool.jpeg` /
`RWS1909 - Cups 01.jpeg`. The file-level tags are the point: PD-old-80-expired
(Waite, the copyright holder, died 1942) plus PD-US (published before 1 January
1931) — public domain in both jurisdictions this project cares about, with no
scan-level permission claim held by anyone.

**Make the provenance provable per card, not asserted.** The fetch step records
each file's Commons licence tag into the art manifest beside the hash and
dimensions, and the build fails if any of the 80 lacks a public-domain tag.
guild-book's pipeline already writes a licence manifest, so this is a field, not
a mechanism. That is what goes in the pack's LICENSE.md — a per-card basis
rather than a sentence claiming one.

*Deferred, not rejected: a black-and-white set.* Chris will source or derive one.
Keep the collection swappable exactly as guild-book's Amendment 3 did (a single
`COLLECTION` constant that the source map, output paths, and manifest all read).

*Not used, and why:* the steve-p.org scans (permission was confirmed on
2026-07-15, but to guild-book, and it does not travel) and Chris's Illustrator
SVG traces (`~/Desktop/Tarot/Rider SVG SouthForkSVG` — almost certainly fine,
since faithful reproductions of public-domain works carry no new copyright per
Bridgeman v. Corel and THJ v Sheridan [2023] EWCA Civ 1354, but a colour-to-ink
trace is a step further from a scan than either case addresses, and "almost
certainly" is a worse footing than a Commons PD tag when the alternative is
free).

### Open questions

1. **How long is the retention window?** The mechanism is settled (lazy expiry
   on read); the number is not. Crawlspace keeps a table about six weeks, which
   is the obvious default and the one to take absent a reason.
2. **Two HMtW card tables, one maintainer.** guild-book has one; this will be a
   second. The divergence cost is real, recurring, and was priced at one
   dismissive sentence in the first draft. The honest version: this is a
   deliberate duplication, justified only if the table's value is being *beside
   the reference people already have open*. If that stops being the reason, the
   right move is to stop and send people to guild-book.

### Considered and rejected

- **Cloning Crawlspace.** No repo, no licence. Clean-room from the book only.
- **Porting guild-book's Challenge engine** — the first draft's whole premise.
  Rejected on review: it is an enforcing engine for a permissive product; it is
  welded to `tenureId` (239 references) and a campaign/adventurer/death model
  this design does not have; `modifiers.ts` cannot be cleanly dropped because the
  reducer and state shape reach into it; and a meaningful share of what would be
  ported (Dooms, death, equipment) is explicitly out of scope. The two patterns
  worth having survive as patterns.
- **Extending guild-book instead of building here.** Still a real option — see
  open question 2.
- **Durable Object + WebSocket push, with a second in-process adapter for
  `adapter-node`.** Chosen on the first pass, then reversed: the goal was
  self-hostability, and a Durable Object is the one primitive a self-hoster
  cannot run, while WebSockets add entrypoint, proxy, and single-process
  frictions that polling does not have. Recorded as an upgrade path with its
  Pages-migration cost priced, above.
- **Campaign-attached tables.** Would reuse invite tokens, roles, and the roll
  log almost for free, but forces campaigns onto a game that has none and puts
  an account between a player and their seat.
- **A generic "live shared surface" `GameModule` contract.** One consumer, no
  second in prospect. A concrete `cardTable` slot instead.
- **Full Crawlspace parity.** The gear model alone is a phase; the city/camp
  panels add UI for something a card flip already covers.
- **Save/restore to a file.** Nothing worth preserving once gear is out, and a
  client-side export of table state would leak the undrawn deck order.
- **Letting a seat take a card from another seat's hand.** Crawlspace allows it
  and asks the holder to hand it back. Rejected: the table needs the AFK case
  (flip the card of a player who has wandered off), and that is satisfied by
  reach over the *table* alone.
- **A scheduled retention sweep.** No good home for a cron, and it would make
  hosted expiry depend on atlas while giving self-hosters nothing.

## Sequencing notes

- Natural session-sized bites: a phase-boundary milestone every 5–10 commits, and each commit is small enough to finish in one sitting.
- When the itch for game #2 arrives (HMtW is the obvious candidate — Arrowed's pack data may even be importable), the test of the framework is that it touches only `content-packs/hmtw/` and `src/lib/games/hmtw/`. If it needs shell changes, that's the extraction moment — do it then, with two real games in hand, not now with one.
